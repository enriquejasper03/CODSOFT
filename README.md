# TASK 1 : CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
Create a basic chatbot designed for simple conversational interactions. It can respond to greetings, share information about itself, tell jokes and interesting facts, and provide the current time when asked. Users interact with the chatbot, and it maintains the conversation until the user types "bye" to end the session. This beginner-friendly project is ideal for learning about natural language processing and fundamental AI concepts, serving as an educational tool for Python developers interested in building their own chatbots.
